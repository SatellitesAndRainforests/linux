____________________________________________________________________________________________________

There are disk based, network based and memory based file systems.
There are 2 types of commands, priviledged and non-priviledged.
Files in /tmp/ are deleted after a defualt 10 days.
A softlink is like a shortcut to another file.
tar is tape archive. Create, append, update, list, extract, compress to/from a single file (tarball).

Files have metadata called an inode, 128 bytes.
An inode has a link to a filename.
The inode does not store the filename. 
The <inode : filename> mappings are kept in the dir's metadata/inode.
All links eventuall point ot the same physical data locaiton.

A hardlink is many filenames to 1 inode. (m:1). A files have the same metadata/inode.
Changes to the inode metadata can be made with each filename.

softlink is like a shortcut
Each softlinke has a uniqe inode with a filepath to the file.

User, Group, Other permissions.
default permissions are set on the umask (user mask).

3 special permission bits for dir's and executables to respond differently to non-root users.
setuid        non users will have run permissions like a user.
setgid        non group members will have run/dir permissions like a group member.
sticky bit    set on a public dir prevents file erasures from non-owners.

The number of inodes on a filesystem is fixed. it is possible to run out of inodes withoutrunning out of disk space.

Networking, Devices, Connections

To share resources/data.
A switch interconnects computers to communicate on the network.
To communicate 1 of its network devices must have a connection profile. with a unique IP,hostname other essential parameters.
The profile may be configured statically or dynamically from a DHCP server for a set amount of time.
A few files define the configuration. 
Using a switch the network can be expanded to include, additional computers, printers, scanners, storage, (nodes).
Computers on the network can be configured to be a file-server, storage server, gateway to the internet.

Configure network interfaces, 
Connection profiles,
Client/ server setups.

A 'hostname' is a unique label assigned to a node to identify it on the network.
/etc/hostname/ --> @witch-x220

Internet Protcol V.4      IpV4        A unique 32 bit software address needed to communicate.
have  'network bits'  and   'node bits'.  (this network, this node).
network address is all 0's
broadcast is al 1's.

The node portion can be subnetted to id more sub-networks. Improving network performance, reducing traffic, easier admin.
subnet mask = the 'network' portion + the 'subnet bits' ... 'node' bits.

It -- does not -- increase the # of ip address in the network. It actually reduces the usable set.
All nodes in a subnet share the same subnet mask.
Each subnet acts as an isolated network, requiring a router to talk to other subnets. 

192.168.1.10/22       <-- IpV4 + CIDR/subnet mask

protocol = rules for formatting, encoding, speed, flow, synchronisation, error, sequencing. 

/etc/protocols      <-- protocol list
/etc/services       <-- ports

TCP       reliable, established a connection with the peer TCP layer, error checking with request packets, sequencing, ACKs, guaranteed data delivery.
UDP       unreliable, conectionaless, no error checking, no Acks,

A private port is generated just for the session between client and its server process.

IMCP  Internet Control Message Protocol  


Ethernet Address/physical,link-layere/MAC address =    differn names for the 48 bit  unique node address.

IP - And - Hardware address     work hand-in-hand. Both are critical to ID the correct destination node on a network.

ARP   (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to enable IP and Hardware address to work in tandem.
      ARP determines the Hardware address of the destination node when the IP address is known.

IpV6    128 bit software address.


NICs    NetworkInterfaceCards provide (1 or many) Ethernet ports. With a 'Connection Profile'. 
        A network device can have many 'Connection Profiles' but only 1 active profile at a time.

Network Interface Names:      eth, em, wlan, lo, wlp3s0, docker0, 

Each network connection has a 'Connection Profile' file read at connection activation stored at:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

nmcli
nmtui
nm-connection-editor      to view, modify, remove, activate, deactivate devices + network connections.

Connection Profile names:      TALKTALK56EC48, raspi-webgui, docker0, br-009090, Wired connection 1
Attached to Device:            wlp3s0, enp0s3

nmcli d s       networkManager list all network device statuses


Each IP address on the system should have a hostname assigned to it.
In a sizable network it is prudent to have some sort of hostname -->  IP address resolution service.
Such as DNS (Domain Name System) for large networks.
For small networks Host Tables in       /etc/hosts      but needs to be updates on each system.

ping      If a ping fails you need to check if the NIC is seated properly, it's driver is installed, the network cable is secure,
          the IP and netmask values are set correctly and the default/ statis route is accurate.
